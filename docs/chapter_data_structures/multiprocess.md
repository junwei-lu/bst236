# Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing in Python allows you to leverage multiple CPU cores to perform computations simultaneously, significantly improving performance for CPU-bound tasks.

## Basic Operations

1. Basic Multiprocessing Components

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
```

- `Pool`: Creates a pool of worker processes
- `cpu_count()`: Returns the number of CPU cores

2. Simple Multiprocessing Example

```python
def process_item(item):
    """Function to process a single item"""
    # Perform computation on the item
    return processed_item

def parallel_processing():
    # Determine number of processes
    num_processes = max(1, cpu_count() - 1)
    
    # Create a process pool
    with Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        # Process items in parallel
        results = pool.map(process_item, data_list)
    
    return results
```


## Performance Considerations


### When to Use Multiprocessing
- CPU-intensive tasks
- Large datasets
- Independent computations
- Data processing and analysis

### Common Pitfalls
- Overhead of creating processes
- Increased memory consumption
- Serialization of data between processes

### Performance Optimization Tips
- Minimize data transfer between processes
- Keep processing functions simple
- Use appropriate chunk sizes
- Monitor memory usage
- Benchmark and profile your code
