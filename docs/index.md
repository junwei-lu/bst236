![Turing](../assets/covers/chapter_welcome_turing.jpg)

Welcome to BST236! I am excited to welcome you to this foundational course where we will explore the integral aspects of statistical computing integrated with advanced generative AI technology. This course is for graduate students at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). Our journey will cover a diverse array of topics from optimization techniques to advanced deep learning, all crucial for effective data analysis. This course is designed to bridge methods with practical application. We will teach how to write efficient and reproducible code with AI copilot. Through collaborative projects, hands-on exercises, and rigorous discussions, you'll gain proficiency in both the conceptual and practical dimensions of computing. I am eager to engage with each of you and see the innovative solutions and perspectives you bring to our class. Let's dive into an exciting semester of learning and discovery!
