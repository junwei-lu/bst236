# Overview

Design the best practices for workflows in scientific computing will make your research more efficient and reliable. We aim to design the workflow that is:

1. **Reproducible**: Future you and other researchers can reproduce your results
2. **Automated**: Reduces time spent on repetitive tasks
3. **Maintainable**: Code remains functional and understandable over time

This chapter covers essential tools and practices for reproducible research:

## Lectures
