# AI-Assisted Coding

## GitHub Copilot 

We strongly recommend you to read the [official documentation](https://github.com/features/copilot) of GitHub Copilot and the VS Code tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github-copilot). There are detailed instructions and examples on how to use different functions of GitHub Copilot there. Here we just want to share some basic tips for using GitHub Copilot effectively.




### What can AI Copilot do?

Below we list the commands you can use in the Copilot Chat. However, you do not need to remember them. You can always type `/` in the chat to see the options (or even not type `/explain` but just ask the AI to explain the code. I guess Github Copilot only optimized the correponding prompt when you use `/`).

What really matters is that the list tells you what you can ask AI to help your coding.

| Command     | Description                                           | Usage                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /explain    | Get code explanations                                 | Open file with code or highlight code you want explained and type: /explain what is the fetchPrediction method? |
| /fix        | Receive a proposed fix for the problems in the selected code | Highlight problematic code and type: /fix propose a fix for the problems in fetchAirports route |
| /tests      | Generate unit tests for selected code                 | Open file with code or highlight code you want tests for and type: /tests |
| /help       | Get help on using Copilot Chat                        | Type: /help what can you do?                                         |
| /doc        | Add a documentation comment                           | Highlight code and type: /doc. You can also press CMD+I in your editor and type /doc/ inline |
| /generate   | Generate code to answer your question                 | Type: /generate code that validates a phone number                   |
| /optimize   | Analyze and improve running time of the selected code | Highlight code and type: /optimize fetchPrediction method            |
| /simplify   | Simplify the selected code                            | Highlight code and type: /simplify                                                                       |

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear and effective prompts to guide AI to generate the desired output.  OpenAI has a detailed prompt engineering [guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) on how to design effective prompts. Actually, you do not even need to memorize all the details in the guide. You can also design a personalized _meta prompt_ to let AI generate good prompts for you, e.g., the openAI [prompt generator](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation). 
#### 0. Always add context

- Include all the related documentations 
- Add comments in the beginning of the file to describe what the file is for
- Include external website links (API docs, etc. if needed)

#### 1. Establish a Clear Objective

* Use a markdown file to write your goals for AI to understand
* Set clear, high-level goals when starting with a blank file/codebase

   
#### 2. Decompose Tasks into Steps

* Break down your task into simple, specific steps after communicating the main goal
* Ask the AI to use "Chain of Thought" to thinkstep by step


#### 3. Provide Examples

- This is called in-context learning. AI performs better when you provide examples.

#### 4. Check the Code

- Always review and validate the code generated by AI
- You can also ask the AI to critique itself and improve the code

## Other AI Copilot IDEs

Beside Github Copilot, there are many other AI coding tools out there, such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf). All tools are evolving very fast and new features are added all the time. Try them out and see which one you like the most.
