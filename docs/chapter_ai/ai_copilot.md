# AI-Assisted Coding

## GitHub Copilot 

We strongly recommend you to read the [official documentation](https://github.com/features/copilot) of GitHub Copilot and the VS Code tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github-copilot). There are detailed instructions and examples on how to use different functions of GitHub Copilot there. Here we just want to share some basic tips for using GitHub Copilot effectively.




### What can AI Copilot do?

Below we list the commands you can use in the Copilot Chat. However, you do not need to remember them. You can always type `/` in the chat to see the options (or even not type `/explain` but just ask the AI to explain the code. I guess Github Copilot only optimized the correponding prompt when you use `/`).

What really matters is that the list tells you what you can ask AI to help your coding.
