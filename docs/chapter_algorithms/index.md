# Overview

This chapter delves into various algorithmic strategies and techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to approach and solve complex problems efficiently. We explore fundamental concepts such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Divide and Conquer, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dynamic Programming, and more. Each section is designed to build your knowledge progressively, with practical examples and visualizations to aid comprehension.
