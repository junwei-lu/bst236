# About this course

This course aims to create a beginner-friendly course on statistical computing.


## Target audience

Whether you're taking your first steps into algorithms and data analysis, or you're looking to strengthen your foundation in statistical computing and establish efficient workflows, this course is designed for you! 

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You should know how to write and read simple code in [python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). You should also have basic knowledge of [probability](https://www.coursicle.com/harvard/courses/BIOSTAT/230/), [statistics](https://www.coursicle.com/harvard/courses/BIOSTAT/232/), and [linear algebra](https://qrd.college.harvard.edu/classes/math-22a-vector-calculus-and-linear-algebra-i).

## Content structure

The main content of the book is shown in the figure below.

- **Workflow**: Covers principles of good coding, especially in efficiency, reproducibility, and AI copilot.  We cover Git and GitHub, Makefile, and virtual environments.

- **Data Structures**: Focuses on Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, and deque, as well as Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames. 

- **Algorithms**: Computation and memory complexity. We will cover recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

- **Numerical Linear Algebra**: Introduce the algorithms for linear algebra, including linear equations, eigenvectors, and more.

- **Optimization**: Introduces algorithms for solving optimization problems, including convex optimization, stochastic optimization, and non-convex optimization.

- **Deep Learning**: introduce the pytorch, deep learning architectures, including neural networks, transformers, and more.
