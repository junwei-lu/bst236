# About this course

This course aims to create a beginner-friendly course on statistical computing.


## Target audience

Whether you're taking your first steps into algorithms and data analysis, or you're looking to strengthen your foundation in statistical computing and establish efficient workflows, this course is designed for you! We'll help you move beyond surface-level understanding to build reproducible analysis pipelines and gain deep insights into how algorithms truly work. If you find yourself wanting to transform your "I think it works" moments into "I know exactly why it works" confidence, while learning best practices for organizing and automating your statistical computing workflows, you're in the right place!

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You should know how to write and read simple code in [python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). You should also have basic knowledge of [probability](https://www.coursicle.com/harvard/courses/BIOSTAT/230/), [statistics](https://www.coursicle.com/harvard/courses/BIOSTAT/232/), and [linear algebra](https://qrd.college.harvard.edu/classes/math-22a-vector-calculus-and-linear-algebra-i).

## Content structure

The main content of the book is shown in the figure below.

- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: introduces core computational concepts, evaluates implementation tradeoffs on time and space complexities, examines performance characteristics, explores real-world use cases, outlines systematic approaches to problem decomposition, and provides practical exercises covering key algorithmic paradigms including sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.

- **Numerical Linear Algebra**: introduce algorithms for solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and more.
- **Optimization**: introduce algorithms for solving optimization problems, including convex optimization, stochastic optimization, and more.
- **Deep Learning**: introduce the pytorch, deep learning architectures, including neural networks, transformers, and more.
- **Reproducible Workflows**: How to make your workflow reproducible and efficient. We will use Git, virtual environments, styled coding, AI assisted coding, and more.
